Scientific machine learning final project: Coronavirus Tweets Text Classification

### Short description of the project
1. What are your hypotheses? Or what are your science questions?

### Some information about the data
2. Which data set are you planning to use? (data size, variable size, data, source, limitations?)

3. How are you going to set up your problem? (Regression, classification, etc) and what are your dependent and independent variables?

Per Arya’s latest email…

(1) what is the problem you want to solve? Why is this problem important? What are the aims/motivations?

Covid was a global issue, 
Twitter facing issues right now with user regulation
Emotionality of tweets reveals important factors about mental health during the pandemic 

(2) Is this an exploratory analysis or hypothesis testing? If former, what are the science questions you hope to answer? If latter, what are your hypotheses?

We expect to see negative tweets in the South and in big cities more often, 
And we would expect negative tweets to decrease with time 

(3) Which data set are you planning to use? Give some information about it, such as data size, variable dimensionality, data source, limitations, or anything else that you think might be important. 

Not many features that go with the data
Unsure how the NLP was done since it was done manually


(4) How are you going to set up this problem? e.g., is this a regression model? is this a classification problem? What are your most important dependent and independent variables?

Supervised; various supervised learning methods in scikit learn, and compare 
Deep learning, compare to traditional machine learning methods
Dependent variables: classification 
Independent variable
